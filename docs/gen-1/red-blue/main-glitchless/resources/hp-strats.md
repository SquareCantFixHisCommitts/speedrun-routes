## Red Glitchless Red Bar Strategies

# Preface
This documentation references different red bar strategies that can be
implemented in order to save time over the normal strategies outlined in the
various guides.
- If an HP is not listed for a fight, assume you default to the normal
  strategy

For some of these strategies, there is a level of risk
involved, as you are often intentionally taking hits from various pokemon
in order to go into red bar.

Strategies here are often crafted with a risk
threshold of 50/24, meaning that someone is willing to take a 50% chance of
dying in order to save 24 seconds.
- This is a pretty aggressive risk threshold originally meant for runners
   doing world record attempts.

If you are not going for world record, it is advised that you take these
strategies with a grain of salt, as these strategies might not be required for
you but can increase the chance of you dying.
